## description

The Focus Flower is an applicaton for the mental health enthusiast. The Focus Flower draws inspiration from cognitive behavioural therapy to help users realign with more positive feeling thoughts. The interface allows users to enter a though they are struggling with and then through a series of inputs the user can reiterate and reframe that though a small step at a time. The end result is a thought that feels much better than the original. After filling out the inputs the user can see their thoughts in a flower diagram to the left.
